As a frequent traveller and the resident planner of my family and friends' vacations, I have spent
countless hours manually comparing tours, accommodations, flights etc. Multiple browser tabs, 
countless Ctrl C Ctrl V clicks, uncountable excel sheets. This manual, error-prone, inefficient 
process often led to frustration and uncertainty about my final choice. 

Hence, I designed and developed this Comparator Tool to streamline the process. A browser extension
that simplifies the comparison and selection experience. 

Read the PRD here, detailing the inspiration, the features, and future vision of this tool.
